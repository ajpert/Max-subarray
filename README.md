# Max-subarray
4 different functions with decreasing run time to find the Max subarray <br />
needs to be compiled with c++ 11 (g++ -std=c++11 your_file.cpp -o your_program) <br />
please enter certain file of numbers in the list of given text files in the command line when running such as ./run num_array_500.txt <br />
you can have your own input if you make your own file, but follow the format of the other files <br />
The different sorting functions are: <br />
1. enumeration (O = n^3) <br />
2. itteration (O = N^2) <br />
3. simplification_deligation (O = Nlog(n)) <br />
4. recursion inversion (O = N) <br />

<br />
This program outputs the time that each takes to run, and the largest sub array added up.
